        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Punjab, located in northwestern India, is a land of fertile plains, robust agricultural productivity and vibrant cultural traditions. Often called the "Granary of India," Punjab's green fields and irrigation systems have long sustained its agrarian economy while its people are known for their hospitality and spirited festivals.</p>

        <p>The state traces its history through ancient river civilizations, Sikh religious development, and modern agricultural reforms. Cities such as Amritsar — home to the Golden Temple — and Chandigarh — a planned city and administrative capital shared with Haryana — are central to Punjabi identity and history.</p>

        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>Punjab's historic role as a frontier region shaped its martial traditions, trade routes, and cultural exchanges. The rise of Sikhism in the region during the 15th and 16th centuries produced a distinct religious and social ethos that continues to influence the state's public life and festivals.</p>

        <h3>Cultural Life</h3>
        <p>Punjabi culture is celebrated globally through Bhangra music and dance, Punjabi folk songs, and a lively tradition of festivals such as Vaisakhi and Lohri.

        <h3>Economy and Agriculture</h3>
        <p>Punjab's economy heavily depends on agriculture, with major crops like wheat and rice forming the backbone of rural livelihoods.
