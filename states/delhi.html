        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Delhi, India's capital territory, is a city of layered histories — a place where ancient monuments stand beside modern government buildings and bustling markets. Its continuous habitation for millennia has created a rich urban tapestry that weaves together Mughal, colonial and contemporary influences. From the imposing walls of the Red Fort to the glass facades of Lutyens' Delhi, the city offers visitors a compact study in contrasting eras.</p>

        <p>The metropolitan region combines New Delhi (the administrative seat), with Old Delhi's narrow lanes and bazaars. Delhi is both a political hub and a cultural crossroads, attracting people from all over India and the world. Its transport connections — major rail termini, an international airport, and an expanding metro network — make it an ideal base for exploring northern India.</p>

        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>Delhi's history is punctuated by successive capitals and empires. Sites like Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb and the Red Fort tell the story of Sultanate and Mughal rule. Colonial-era landmarks such as India Gate and Parliament reflect the British imprint and the later creation of independent India's governance. The city's museums, monuments and archives preserve layers of social and political history that explain modern India.</p>

        <h3>Cultural Life</h3>
        <p>Delhi is a cultural magnet — home to leading theaters, galleries, and festivals. The city nurtures classical and contemporary performing arts, with institutions like the National School of Drama and cultural complexes staging plays, music and dance throughout the year. Delhi's multilingual population enriches its cuisine, rituals and festivals, making the city a microcosm of India's diversity.</p>

        <h3>Visitor Experience</h3>
        <p>Tourists can explore historical quarters, savor street food in Chandni Chowk, visit world-class museums, and shop at modern malls or craft bazaars. Green spaces such as Lodhi Gardens and Deer Park offer respite from urban energy. Delhi's food scene — from kebabs and chaat to modern fusion restaurants — is as cosmopolitan as its residents.</p>
